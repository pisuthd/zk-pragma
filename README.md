## Repository structure

The project using a monorepo structure consists of 4 different packages that have been interconnected using [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org).

- `client`: the frontend application made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), incorporates the necessary Web3 and ZK libraries.
- `contracts`: contains [Circom](https://docs.circom.io/)'s circuits and a `zkGPT.sol` main contract that inherits the autogenerated verifier contracts made from [snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs). All documents and hubs must be hashed using [Poseidon](https://www.poseidon-hash.info/) hash and imported and verified within the contracts.
- `lib`: source code for zkGPT node, separate for better unit and integration tests with other package.
- `node`: the zkGPT node contains the document database implemented using [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/), processes all AI-related operations and also incorporates [Langchain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) for parsing documents in and out within LLM models.
